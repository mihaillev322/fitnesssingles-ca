<h1>About This US Niche Resource: Method and Standards</h1>

<section id="mission" aria-labelledby="mission-heading">
<h2 id="mission-heading">Mission and audience</h2>
<p>This resource hub exists to provide clear, accurate, and actionable information for individuals and organizations navigating complex topics within the United States. Our mission is to serve as a trusted intermediary between authoritative primary sources and users who need practical guidance without wading through dense technical or legal language. We believe that access to reliable information should not require specialized training or expensive professional consultations for every question that arises.</p>
<p>Our primary audience consists of US-based individuals seeking to understand their options, obligations, and opportunities across various domains. This includes people conducting personal research for important life decisions, small business owners working to understand compliance requirements, students and researchers seeking reliable reference materials, and professionals who need quick access to verified information outside their primary area of expertise. We also serve those who are new to the United States and need to understand how American systems and processes function.</p>
<p>We recognize that our audience has varying levels of prior knowledge and different learning preferences. Some visitors arrive with substantial background and need only specific details or updates. Others are encountering topics for the first time and require foundational explanations before they can engage with more advanced material. Our content is structured to accommodate both approaches, with clear organization that allows experienced users to navigate directly to relevant sections while providing sufficient context for newcomers to build understanding progressively.</p>
<p>This site focuses specifically on the United States context. While some principles and practices may apply more broadly, our guidance is developed with US regulations, standards, and cultural norms in mind. Users in other countries should verify that information applies to their jurisdiction before acting upon it. Even within the United States, significant variations exist between states and localities, and we encourage users to research requirements specific to their geographic location.</p>
<p>It is equally important to understand what this site does not do. We do not provide legal advice, and our content should not be treated as a substitute for consultation with qualified attorneys when legal questions arise. We do not provide financial advice, and users should consult appropriate financial professionals for investment, tax, or other financial decisions. We do not provide medical advice, and health-related decisions should involve qualified healthcare providers. Our role is to provide general information and guidance that helps users understand their situations and ask better questions when they do engage with professionals.</p>
<p>We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of accuracy and usefulness in our content. This commitment drives our editorial processes, source selection criteria, and ongoing review procedures. The following sections explain how we develop and maintain the information presented throughout this site.</p>
</section>
<section id="method" aria-labelledby="method-heading">
<h2 id="method-heading">Research and editorial method</h2>
<p>Our editorial process is designed to ensure that all content meets rigorous standards for accuracy, currency, and practical usefulness. Every piece of guidance published on this site goes through a structured development and review process before publication, and existing content is subject to periodic review and updates as circumstances warrant.</p>
<p>Content development begins with identifying topics of significant interest or importance to our target audience. We monitor common questions, emerging issues, and areas where reliable information appears to be lacking or difficult to access. Once a topic is selected, we conduct comprehensive research using the source hierarchy described in the following section, prioritizing authoritative primary sources over secondary interpretations.</p>
<p>During the research phase, we gather information from multiple independent sources to verify accuracy through triangulation. Claims that cannot be verified through multiple authoritative sources are either excluded or clearly marked as preliminary or contested. We pay particular attention to the currency of information, as regulations and best practices evolve continuously. Publication dates and update histories are checked for all sources, and we seek out the most recent authoritative guidance available.</p>
<p>Draft content is reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and practical usefulness. We evaluate whether the information would actually help someone in the target audience make better decisions or take appropriate action. Technical accuracy is necessary but not sufficient; content must also be accessible to users without specialized training in the relevant field. We revise drafts as needed to improve clarity without sacrificing accuracy or nuance.</p>
<p>Published content is not considered final. We maintain a review schedule that ensures all content is evaluated at least annually for continued accuracy and relevance. More frequent reviews are triggered by significant regulatory changes, new research findings, or user feedback indicating potential issues. When updates are needed, we revise content promptly and note significant changes where appropriate.</p>
<p>Our commitment to accuracy extends to acknowledging limitations and uncertainties. Where authoritative sources disagree, we present the range of perspectives rather than arbitrarily selecting one. Where information is preliminary or subject to change, we say so clearly. Where professional consultation is advisable, we recommend it explicitly rather than encouraging users to rely solely on general guidance.</p>
<p>For additional information on research methodology standards, the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Library of Congress</a> provides extensive resources on information literacy and source evaluation. The <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</a> publishes guidance on research standards and evidence evaluation that informs our approach.</p>

<section id="sources" aria-labelledby="sources-heading">
<h2 id="sources-heading">Source quality rubric (table)</h2>
<p>We evaluate sources according to a structured rubric that considers authority, accuracy, currency, and relevance. The following table describes our source tier system and how different types of sources are used in developing content for this site.</p>

<p>This tiered approach ensures that our most important claims rest on the most authoritative foundations, while still allowing us to provide context and accessibility through secondary and tertiary sources where appropriate. When sources conflict, we generally defer to higher-tier sources unless there is specific reason to question their applicability to the situation at hand.</p>

<section id="accessibility" aria-labelledby="accessibility-heading">
<h2 id="accessibility-heading">Accessibility and usability</h2>
<p>We are committed to making this resource accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Our site is built using semantic HTML5 that provides meaningful structure for assistive technologies such as screen readers. We use proper heading hierarchy, landmark regions, and descriptive link text to support navigation by users who cannot see the visual layout.</p>
<p>Keyboard navigation is fully supported throughout the site. All interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard, without requiring a mouse or other pointing device. Focus indicators are clearly visible, using our accent color with appropriate contrast to show which element currently has keyboard focus. Users can navigate through content using standard keyboard conventions including Tab, Enter, and arrow keys where appropriate.</p>
<p>We respect user preferences for reduced motion. Users who have indicated a preference for reduced motion in their operating system or browser settings will not see animations or transitions on this site. This accommodation helps users who experience discomfort or disorientation from animated content, including some users with vestibular disorders.</p>
<p>Color is not used as the only means of conveying information. While we use color to enhance visual presentation, all information communicated through color is also available through other means such as text labels, patterns, or position. This ensures that users with color vision deficiencies can access all content and functionality.</p>
<p>Text is presented at readable sizes with sufficient contrast against background colors. Our typography scales responsively based on viewport size and respects user font size preferences. Line lengths are constrained to support comfortable reading, and adequate spacing is provided between elements to reduce visual crowding.</p>
<p>Tables include proper markup with headers, captions, and scope attributes to ensure that relationships between cells are clear to users of assistive technologies. On smaller screens, tables can be scrolled horizontally while maintaining their structural integrity, allowing users to access all data without loss of context.</p>
</section>
<section id="contact" aria-labelledby="contact-heading">
